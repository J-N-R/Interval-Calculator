# Source Code (Java)
The entirety of the project was coded in Java, with the GUI being developed and generated using the Java SWT Library. 

To implement intervals, interval arithmetic, and different types of intervals, I used an Object Oriented Approach and created the "Interval" class.

Without the use of PolyMorphism, these "Intervals" already have the tools necessary to efficiently take on other forms through the use of a 'pointer' object, allowing for intervals to have as many unions as they would like, structured very similarly to a singly linked-list.

# Notes
This project was created in a hurry. Currently, this branch contains the project in its original form, but since I've created this program, I've learned much more. Unfortunately due to time constraints, I wasn't able to polish it fully the way I would like, and so there are a few areas that could use improvement.

My plan is to clean up the project once my current school semester is over, and with my new knowledge I would like to improve the project as best I can.
