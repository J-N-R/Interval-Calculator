# Source Code (Java)
The entirety of the project was coded in Java, with the GUI being developed and generated using the Java SWT Library. 

To implement intervals, interval arithmetic, and different types of intervals, I used an Object Oriented Approach and created the "Interval" class.

Without the use of PolyMorphism, these "Intervals" already have the tools necessary to efficiently take on other forms through the use of a 'pointer' object, allowing for intervals to have as many unions as they would like, structured very similarly to a singly linked-list.
