# Interval-Calculator
A repository hosting all files related to my Interval Calculator project for my Summer 2020 Research. Its main purpose is to be able to create intervals and allow them to operate with one another. Also allows for operations between intervals with Unions, as well as Negative Intervals.

Check the "Source Code" folder for additional notes.

# Note:
Since I built this tool as a simple tool to help my team and to have fun practicing my coding, it may not have the best coding style or most efficient algorithms, and I have learned a lot since I originally programmed this project years ago. Please keep this in mind when reviewing the code! :)
