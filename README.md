# Interval-Calculator
A repository hosting all files related to my Interval Calculator project for my Summer 2020 Research. Built in a bit of a rush, the main purpose was to be able to create intervals and allow them to operate with one another. Also allows for operations between intervals with Unions, as well as Negative Intervals.
